# General contribution criteria

Please have a look at our contribution guidelines: https://github.com/hoangsetup/n8n-nodes-chatwork/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

The following short checklist can be used to make sure your PR is of good
quality, and can be merged easily:

- [ ] if it resolves an issue;
      is a reference (i.e. #1) to this issue included?
- [ ] if it introduces a new functionality or configuration flag;
      did you document this in the references or guides?
